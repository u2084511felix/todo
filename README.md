## CLI TODO Appication written in C for linux systems.

### Setup guide.

#### 1. Clone to your home dir.
#### 2. Create a symlink to the binary: 
`sudo ln -s ~/todo/todo /usr/local/bin/todo`
#### 3. Run from anywhere:

Optional: 
Fork the repo as a private repo and commit changes to your github to keep a single todo list accross all your workstations.
